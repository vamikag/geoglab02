# Lab 2 — Web Data Collection & Visualization 

## Topic
This project explores how YouTube presents content related to ice cream using different search intents.

## Search terms used
- ice cream recipe
- best ice cream shops
- ice cream business

## Why this comparison
Although all searches focus on ice cream, each represents a different intent:
- instructional (recipes),
- discovery (shops),
- entrepreneurial (business).

Comparing them highlights how language and framing differ across similar topics.

## Observations from word clouds
- Recipe searches emphasize ingredients and ease of preparation.
- Shop searches highlight locations, reviews, and brands.
- Business searches focus on strategy, profit, and entrepreneurship.

## What stood out
The differences between word usage were stronger than expected, even though all searches were about the same product.

## Improvements for future research
- Collect more videos per search term.
- Run crawls across multiple days.
- Apply text cleaning before visualization.
- Add geographic tagging for mapping.
